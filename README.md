# Project Outline
Lion Pride Finds is a “Scavenger Hunt” / “Educational” style Augmented Reality experience. <br><br>
York University is the 3rd largest campus in Canada. Being on campus for the first time can be confusing and many people don’t know the rich (and complicated) history behind our university. This Mobile AR experience is to guide and educate new as well as existing “Lions” about the university. <br><br>
Users are invited to explore campus and use the AR application to learn some fun facts associated with the university and its history.
